# Swift Playgrounds extension for Visual Studio Code

Swift Playgrounds in Xcode are a great tool to learn Swift. Swift has been available on Linux for some time now, but anything similar to a Playground doesn't exist. This project is an attempt to bring playgrounds to VSCode such that Linux users can also enjoy them.

## Experimental

The current version is very experimental with only a couple of functions implemented (notably runtime variable inspection).

## Installation

Install the extension via the extension marketplace in Visual Studio Code.
